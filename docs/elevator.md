## Detailed Specification

### Overview

Axis is a Windows desktop assistant that leverages natural language processing and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide intelligent interaction with computer resources. Unlike basic voice assistants or search tools, Axis integrates deeply with the Windows operating system and applications to perform complex tasks through natural language commands, context-aware assistance, and proactive suggestions.

### Core Architecture

Axis is built on five fundamental architectural components:

1. **Frontend Interface**: An Electron-based user interface providing the command bar, response area, context panel, and system tray presence. The interface is designed for minimal intrusion into workspace while remaining instantly accessible.

2. **Core Engine**: Implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that powers the AI capabilities. This engine processes natural language, maintains contextual understanding, and coordinates tool execution.

3. **Windows Integration Layer**: Deep integration with Windows APIs enabling control of the operating system, applications, and system resources. This layer provides access to file systems, application launching, window management, system settings, and more.

4. **Context Management System**: Sophisticated system for tracking user context across applications, documents, and tasks. Context is maintained at configurable levels (command, conversation, session, or persistent) and includes active application awareness, document content understanding, and task continuity.

5. **Security Layer**: Comprehensive security and privacy architecture ensuring user data protection through permission controls, local processing options, authentication mechanisms, and secure data handling protocols.

### User Interface Components

Axis features a minimalist interface designed to stay out of the user's way while remaining accessible:

- **Command Interface**: The primary input area, activated via Ctrl+Space (default hotkey), where users can type or dictate commands in natural language.

- **Response Panel**: Where Axis displays responses, suggestions, and interactive elements based on user commands and context.

- **Context Sidebar**: Optional panel showing current context and command history, providing transparency into what information Axis is using.

- **System Tray Icon**: Provides quick access to Axis and displays status information about the assistant's current state.

- **Settings Panel**: Comprehensive configuration interface for customizing all aspects of Axis behavior.

### Key Capabilities
