## How We Prioritize Features

When planning new versions, we prioritize:

1. **User Value**: Features that deliver the most value to users
2. **Technical Foundation**: Building robust technical infrastructure
3. **User Feedback**: Addressing the most requested features from beta testers
4. **Technology Advancements**: Leveraging new AI and system capabilities as they emerge

## Providing Feedback

Your feedback is essential for shaping Axis's future. Please share your suggestions through:

- In-app feedback tool (in pre-release versions)
- Email: <axis-feedback@auxiliary.com>
- Beta tester forum: [beta.auxiliary.com/axis](https://beta.auxiliary.com/axis)

We particularly value feedback on:

- Feature requests
- Performance issues
- User experience pain points
- Integration needs

## Version Numbering

Axis follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Significant new features or fundamental changes
- **MINOR**: New features and improvements with backward compatibility
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and minor improvements
