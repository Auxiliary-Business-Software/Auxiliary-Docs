## Supported Frameworks

Auxiliary projects use:

- **Frontend:** Electron (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **Backend:** Python + FastAPI

## Framework Selection Guidelines

All new projects should use Electron for the frontend and Python + FastAPI for the backend unless there is a strong technical justification for an exception.
